# PearlBorder

> A simple plugin to prevent enderpearls from being used to escape the worldborder.

This plugin is so simple that it doesn't even have a config or command or anything. It simply checks if an enderpearl falls outside of the worldborder, and then cancels it if so.

## Installation

Just download the JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/PearlBorder/releases) and drop it in your plugins folder. That's it!
